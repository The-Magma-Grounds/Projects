Do **not** touch anything within my projects. If you wish to contribute, please ask me on my Discord, or by opening an issue here.
I'm also **not** responsibe for any issues that occur. They're usually caused by dead/unsupported mods or OptiFine, which I have no control over. This issue tracker is only meant for basic bugs and suggestions that I'm actually able to do.
